Hostel Management System

A Simple yet Effective C++ Mini Project

As part of my college mini project, I developed a Hostel Management System using C++ that demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, particularly inheritance.
This project showcases my ability to design and implement a simple yet functional system that can be scaled up to manage hostel operations efficiently.

Key Features:

Inheritance-based Design: The system utilizes inheritance to create a hierarchical structure of classes, enabling efficient management of hostel rooms, students, and staff.
User-Friendly Interface: The command-line interface provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the system, making it easy to perform tasks such as room allocation, student registration,
and staff management.
Data Management: The system effectively manages data related to students, staff, and rooms, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

Technical Details:

Programming Language: C++
Development Environment: Dev c/c++
Design Patterns: Inheritance-based design
What I Learned:

Object-Oriented Programming: This project helped me solidify my understanding of OOP concepts, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Problem-Solving: I developed problem-solving skills by breaking down complex requirements into manageable components and implementing them effectively.
Code Organization: I learned to organize code in a modular and structured manner, making it easier to maintain and extend.

Future Scope:

Database Integration: Integrating a database to store and retrieve data, enabling more efficient data management and scalability.
GUI Development: Developing a graphical user interface to enhance user experience and make the system more accessible.
